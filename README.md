## Usage

You will need to setup an `.env` file with the following variables:

`LLM_API_KEY`: Can be either OpenAI key, Claude key or any other LLM provider key. (See LiteLLM docs above for full info on supported LLMs)

`LLM_MODEL`: The model you want to use. (See LiteLLM docs above for full info on supported LLMs)

Scraper keys: they're optional, but if not provided, you will need to scrape and pass the HTMLs to OxyÂ® Parser yourself.
However, we highly suggest to use Oxylabs scraper since it will remove the hassle of getting HTMLs and will also
provide you with a lot of other benefits like rotating IPs, handling captchas, bypassing blocks.
